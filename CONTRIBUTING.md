## Welcome! 

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to our opendata.dc-samples

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING guide (you are here), our [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and our [README](README.md), all of which should be in this repository. If you have any questions, you can email the DC Data team at [data@dc.gov](mailto:data@dc.gov).

## Ways to Contribute

**The DC Data Team under the management of the Chief Data Officer manages all updates, bugs, and feature additions via GitHub's public [issue tracker](https://github.com/DCgov/opendatadc-starterkit/issues) in this repository.** 

If you do not already have a GitHub account, you can [sign up for GitHub here](https://github.com/). Pull requests will be reviewed and accepted. In the spirit of open source software, everyone is encouraged to help improve this project. Here are some ways you can contribute:
- by reporting bugs as issues
- by suggesting new samples
- by adding code for new samples
- by writing or editing documentation
- by closing issues

#### Submit Great Issues
* Before submitting a new [issue](https://github.com/DCgov/opendatadc-starterkit/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), check to make sure [a similar issue isn't already open](https://github.com/DCgov/opendatadc-starterkit/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen). If one is, contribute to that issue thread with your feedback.
* When submitting a bug report, please try to provide as much detail as possible, i.e. a screenshot or [gist](https://gist.github.com/) that demonstrates the problem, the technology you are using, and any relevant links. 

#### Ready for your Help 
Issues labeled :sparkles:[`help wanted`](labels/help%20wanted):sparkles: make it easy for you to find ways you can contribute today. 

#### If you want to add a new sample to the repo
Our special request is for new samples. We know that we haven't covered the gamut of tools that can turn geojson/json/esri-json into rich and useful data products. We started this repo with the tools and frameworks we know best, but would love to see how you're able to load opendata.dc.gov APIs into your favorite data clients and tools. 

Our samples target the new developer, who has some knowledge of popular languages and coding concepts and practices. We want to teach the widest range of users to do the widest range of things possible with our [open data platform](http://opendata.dc.gov). So far, we've focused on HTML/javascript and the display of data using the live APIs, but would welcome samples that use python and r to manipulate data in the various download formats (csv, shapefile, kml).

To this end, new samples should:
- demonstrate how to use the data available on opendata.dc.gov
- be contained on a single page (seperate files only for assets like images and supplementary data)
- use simple and concise code that is heavily and helpfully commented
- give proper credit to any inspirations and data sources (ours and others) (this includes basemaps like openstreetmap, and cool samples found in coding blogs)
- follow the overall look-and-feel of the existing samples (where appropriate)
